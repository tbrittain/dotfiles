# dotfiles

This assumes use with a WSL distro (since that is is how I have been developing on Windows machines)

## Configuration

1. Install a Linux distro such as Ubuntu

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

2. Bootstrap the environment

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbrittain/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash
```
